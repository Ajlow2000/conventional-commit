# Conventional Commit
A Commit helper implemented in rust ~~according to~~ loosely based on https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

A config file can be created in the root of your git repo to control default values for that project.
It is suggested to ignore the `.conventional-commit.toml` file in your users global git config file to
avoid accidentally committing it to various projects.
